# SCHOLARPATH
A navigation website for students to access Scholar Path 
This is a project I worked on solo for my course CS3337 at CSULA built with mostly HTML, JS and CSS. Alongside with peers who worked on the backend of this project.
This was the front end of a navigation app "Scholar Path" which was able to help students navigate throughout campus using a GPS. 
In theory it would navigate through individual buildings and floors until you reached your destination. 


Features that can be implemented:
-- Security using CRUD can/need to be implemented
-- Integrate it with the backend of this project (which I do not have)
